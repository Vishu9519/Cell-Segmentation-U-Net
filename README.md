# Cell-Segmentation-U-Net
A Project for the course CS435 at IIT Goa


To run the code, first of all open the notebook file in colab.

Create a folder in your google drive home as CS435Project, and copy the zip files from the following link and place it in the created folder:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wWmGTdo4UeqRCw9HqyrBJs5lupJy7ask?usp=share_link

(You can also create different folder names, but then some slight modification has to be made in the code. Just change the Train_path and Test_path in the code to the path where the zip files are located)

Run the code.
